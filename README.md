Mayan Math teaches you about how the Maya represented numbers. It allows you to create a number or convert a number.

For this project, I used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to host the images, [Framer](https://www.framer.com/) for animations, and [React Tabs](https://www.framer.com/). I exported the project so it could be hosted on a static site.
